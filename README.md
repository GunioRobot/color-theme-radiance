# color-theme-radiance

I wanted a color-theme that would go well with Ubuntu's Radiance
theme. The great majority of colors are from [Ubuntu colour palette and
colour landscapes][1] document.

## Contributing

Contributions very welcome! Try to use Ubuntu/Canonical colors where
possible but it's not mandatory. People edit all sorts of languages
with Emacs and I can't check them all to see how they work so if yours
is not looking nice, create an issue or a pull request.
